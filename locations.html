                Andhra Pradesh was once a major Buddhist pilgrimage site in the country and also a Buddhist learning center which can be seen in many sites in the state in the form of monastery ruins, chaityas and stupas.
                It is also known for being the land of Koh-i-Noor and other globally known diamonds which originated from the Kollur Mine.
                The state is also a major producer of rice with which it is also known as the "Rice bowl of India".
                The state's official language is Telugu; one of the classical languages of India,
                 the fourth most spoken language in India and the 13th-most spoken language in the world.
                 Andhra Pradesh's second official language is Urdu.
            </p>
            <p>As per the 8th century BCE Rigvedic text Aitareya Brahmana,
                 the Andhras left North India off the banks of the Yamuna river and migrated to South India.
                  In the third century BCE, Andhra was a vassal kingdom of Ashoka of the Mauryan Empire. 
                  After his death, it became powerful and extended its empire to the whole Maratha country and beyond under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty. 
                  After that, the major rulers included the Pallavas, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, 
                  Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahi dynasty, Nizam dynasty, East India Company, and British Raj.</p>

                <p>1. Andhra Pradesh comprises two major regions namely Rayalaseema in the south-west and Coastal Andhra bordering the Bay of Bengal in the east.
                    The state has 26 districts,18 in Coastal Andhra and 8 in Rayalaseema. 
                    The state also borders a union territory, Yanam  a district of Puducherry, 
                    which lies to the south of Kakinada in the Godavari delta on the eastern side of the state.
                     The economy of Andhra Pradesh is the 8th largest in India, 
                     with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹8.84 trillion (US$110 billion) and has the country's 17th-highest GSDP per capita of ₹170,000 (US$2,100). 
                     Andhra Pradesh ranks 27th among Indian states in Human Development Index (HDI). 
                     It has a jurisdiction over almost 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) of territorial waters..</p>

                <p>2. The Assaka mahajanapada, one of the sixteen Vedic mahajanapadas, 
                    included Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Telangana.
                    Archaeological evidence from places such as Bhattiprolu, Amaravati, Dharanikota, and Vaddamanu suggests that the Andhra region was part of the Mauryan empire.
                     Amaravati might have been a regional centre under Mauryan rule. 
                     After the death of Emperor Ashoka, Mauryan rule weakened around 200 BCE and was replaced by several smaller kingdoms in the Andhra region.
                     One of the earliest examples of the Brahmi script, the progenitor of several scripts, 
                     including Telugu, comes from Bhattiprolu, where the script was used on an urn containing the relics of Buddha.

                    The Satavahana dynasty dominated the Deccan plateau from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE.
                    It had trade relations with the Roman Empire.
                    The later Satavahanas made Dharanikota, near Amaravati, their capital.
                     According to the Buddhists, Nagarjuna, the philosopher of Mahayana, lived in this region.
                     The Andhra Ikshvakus, with their capital at Vijayapuri, succeeded the Satavahanas in the Krishna River valley in the latter half of the 2nd century.
                     The Salankayanas were an ancient dynasty that ruled the Andhra region between Godavari and Krishna with their capital at Vengi (modern Pedavegi) from 300 to 440 CE.
                     Telugu Cholas ruled present-day Rayalaseema from the fifth to the eleventh centuries from Cuddapa and Jammalamadugu. 
                     The Telugu inscription of Erikal Mutturaju Dhananjaya Varma, known as Erragudipadu sasanam, was engraved in 575 CE in the present Kadapa district. 
                     It is the earliest written record in Telugu..</p>

                Tamil Nadu is the southernmost state of India. The tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population,
                 Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil people, who speak the Tamil language,
                  one of the longest surviving classical languages and serves as its official language. 
                  The capital and largest city is Chennai.

                Located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, 
                Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, 
                the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, 
                the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, 
                the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula,
                 with the river Kaveri bisecting the state. Politically,
                  Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh,
                   and the union territory of Puducherry and shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island.

                Archaeological evidence points to Tamil Nadu being inhabited for more than 400 millennia and has more than 5,500 years of continuous cultural history.
                 Historically, the Tamilakam region was inhabited by Tamil-speaking Dravidian people and was ruled by several regimes over centuries, 
                 such as the Sangam era triumverate of the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas, the Pallavas (3rd–9th century CE), and 
                 the later Vijayanagara Empire (14th–17th century CE).
                  European colonization began with establishing trade ports in the 17th century, 
                  with the British controlling much of South India as the Madras Presidency for two centuries before the Indian Independence in 1947. 
                  After independence, the region became the Madras State of the Republic of India and was further re-organized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape. 
                  The state was renamed as Tamil Nadu, meaning "Tamil Country", in 1969. Hence, culture, cuisine and architecture have seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely

                Kerala is  called Keralam in Malayalam (Malayalam: [ke:ɾɐɭɐm] ⓘ),
                 is a state on the Malabar Coast of India.[15] It was formed on 1 November 1956,
                  following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act,
                   by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore.
                   Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by area. 
                   It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. 
                   With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. 
                   It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. 
                   Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.

                The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. 
                The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). 
                The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE.
                The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. 
                In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala,
                and paved the way for European colonisation of India.

                    At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century,
                    there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. 
                    They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949. 
                    The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India,
                    which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence.
                    After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956,
                    the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State
                    (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti),
                    the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi 
                    (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks). </p>

                Delhi,[a] officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi (ISO: Rāṣṭrīya Rājadhānī Kṣētra Dillī), 
                is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.
                 Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank,
                 Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. 
                 Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.
                  The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).
                   According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.

                 has an estimated population of over 28 million,

                <p>The topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches ,
                    the literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however,
                    excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. 
                    From the early 13th century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, 
                    the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia. 
                    All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. 
                    Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. 
                    The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it.
                    The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of Urdu and later Modern Standard Hindi. 
                    Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib.
                    Delhi was a notable centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. 
                    In 1911, New Delhi, a southern region within Delhi, became the capital of the British Indian Empire.
                    During the Partition of India in 1947, Delhi was transformed from a Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslim residents, 
                    in part due to the pressure brought to bear by arriving Hindu and Sikh refugees from western Punjab.
                    After independence in 1947, New Delhi continued as the capital of the Dominion of India, and after 1950 of the Republic of India.</p>
